# Data visualization using Power BI Dashboard

## Problem Statement
The price of an airline ticket is influenced by numerous factors, such as flight duration, days left until departure, arrival and departure times, and more. Airlines often adjust ticket prices dynamically based on market demand and availability, using proprietary rules and algorithms. Understanding these factors can help businesses optimize pricing strategies and provide customers with better value.

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing these factors to gain actionable insights.

## Project Overview
### Objective
Develop an interactive Power BI Dashboard to analyze and visualize data related to airline ticket pricing. The dashboard should highlight trends, relationships, and factors that influence ticket prices, providing insights through effective data visualization.

### Key Features of Power BI Dashboards
Dynamic updates: Dashboards update automatically as the underlying data changes.
Drag-and-drop functionality for creating custom visualizations.
Support for various charts, graphs, and plots to represent data effectively.
## Task Explanation
The project involves creating visualizations using Power BI to address the following key questions:

1. Flight Distribution
- Analyze the count of flights operated by different airlines.
- Explore the distribution of classes across various airlines.
  
2. Ticket Pricing Analysis
- Compare ticket prices across different airlines and flight classes.

3. Impact of Stops
- Investigate how the number of stops influences ticket pricing.
